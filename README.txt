README - How to use this static portfolio site

Files:
- index.html : main HTML file (Arabic, dark theme)
- style.css : styles used by index.html
- logo.png : your logo (if provided)

How to preview locally:
1) Unzip the package.
2) Open index.html in your browser (double-click). The site is static and will run without a server.
   - Note: For some browsers, loading local files may restrict images due to security settings. If the logo doesn't show, open with a simple local server:
     - Python 3: `python -m http.server 8000` then open http://localhost:8000
     - Or use VS Code Live Server extension.

How to deploy to GitHub Pages:
1) Create a new repository named: <your-username>.github.io
2) Upload all files from this folder to the repository root.
3) Commit and push. The site will be available at https://<your-username>.github.io after a minute.
